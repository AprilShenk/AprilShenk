### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm April

I started my journey of Software Engineering at the beginning of 2020. A few months later, I lost my full-time job due to COVID-19, which provided me an opportunity to learn full time. After four months of learning the basics, I started General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI), a 12-week full-time program. The SEI taught me about Big-O notation, algorithms, MVC architecture, and utilizing git.

I am focusing now on making the world a better place.

In my personal life, it looks like:

- Sustainable purchasing

- Discussing current issues with my community

- Reducing my carbon footprint

In the workplace, I achieve this by:

- Reducing tedious workflows with automation

- Constantly improving team processes

- Providing support for a product that decreases frustration in the manufacturing supply chain

- Involved as Vice President of the Environmental Employee Resource Group identifying company-wide initiatives for sustainability
